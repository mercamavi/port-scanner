    "A port scanner is a valuable tool that hackers use to perform reiconnansse\n",
    "of your network to find a point of entry to the system. On the other hand,\n",

    "malicious actors attack. In this project I construct a simple port scanner with python.\n",

    "But First, a little networking review:\n",
    "In order to cummunicate with each other in a network ,computers are identified with an IP ADDRESS.\n",
    "As multiple applications are running in a computer , a PORT is required to identify them according\n",
    "to the service they perfom. Additionally it is neccesary a PROTOCOL to define the rules for that \n",
    "communication.In this way appears the concept of SOCKET that is a software entity created at each \n",
    "side(computer) of the communication link and composed of protocol,Ip Address and Port.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an application in one computer communicate with a remote computer a Socket is created in each side.\n",
    "If the requiered PORT is closed in one side and you try to connect with it then a malfunction occurr in\n",
    "the communication. This program uses python library called \"socket\" to connect to the port, if the port is\n",
    "closed then an Exception is generated.This way you can identify when the port is closed or not."
